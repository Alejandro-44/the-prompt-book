## Overview

This is a social network for prompts. The idea is for users to connect, share, and comment on prompts that have been useful to them in their daily lives. This way, the community can get constant feedback on how to use LLMs to create content or automate tasks. In addition, the community can share the different prompt engineering strategies they have used. 

Users are be able to:

- Register and log in
- Post prompts 
- Share multimedia results from prompts
- Comment on prompts
- Like prompts
- Search prompts by text

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Components Library
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.com/) - Python Library
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) - Database

### What I learned

In this project, I applied layer separation to build the backend.

I learned a lot about asynchronous Python to use the pymongo controller and about the UV package manager.

I learned how to apply different levels of testing and their importance for software development. In this process, I learned about testing libraries such as pytest, testcontainers, MockServiceWorkers, vitest, and ReactTestContainers.

### Continued development

I hope to continue improving this project. First, I would like to improve the UI and UX based on feedback from the community. Then, I would like to implement interactive copying for prompts, meaning that when copying, the variables in the prompt can be replaced with the inputs needed by the user.
